# Malaria Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to classify cell images as infected or uninfected by malaria. The goal is to assist in the early detection and treatment of malaria through automated image classification.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Uses Keras Sequential API to build a CNN with multiple layers, including convolutional, pooling, and dropout layers.
- **Batch Normalization**: Improves training stability and accelerates convergence.
- **Customizable Model**: Designed for easy experimentation with hyperparameters and layers.
- **VGG16**: A pre-trained deep learning model fine-tuned for this task.
- **Machine Learning**:
-   ***Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A classical machine learning approach applied to extracted features.
-   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A distance-based classifier tested on the dataset.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy
```

# üê≥ Running the Malaria Detection Project with Docker

This section explains how to containerize and run the Malaria Detection project using Docker. Docker ensures a consistent environment across machines and simplifies deployment.

---

## üì¶ Step 1: Create a `Dockerfile`

Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root of your project:

```Dockerfile
# Use official Python image
FROM python:3.10

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy project files
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy scikit-learn

# Expose port (optional, if using a web interface)
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the main script
CMD ["python", "malaria_detection.py"]

```

## Dataset
The project requires a dataset of cell images, categorized into infected and uninfected classes. Ensure the dataset is organized as follows:

```
./Malaria Cells
  /single_prediction
  /train
    /Parasitized
    /uninfected
  /test
    /Parasitized
    /uninfected
./Test_Images
```


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salehbeda41/Disease-Prediction-Model-master.git
   cd Disease-Prediction-Model-master
   ```

2. Ensure the dataset is in place.

3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook malaria-pred.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## CNN Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max pooling layers
- Dropout layers for regularization
